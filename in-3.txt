The first operation generally performed 
on an object of one of these classes is 
to associate it to a real file. This 


procedure is known as to open a file. 
An open file is represented within a 
program by a stream (i.e., an object 


of one of these classes; in the previous 
example, this was myfile) and any input 
or output operation performed on this 
stream object will be applied


 to the physical file associated to it.
